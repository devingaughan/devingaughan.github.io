                    <h3>Hello, students, parents and friends!</h3>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p> I am a professional violin teacher and performer based in the Pasadena, California area.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Selecting the right teacher for your child is critically important because quality instruction gives students the opportunity to follow their love for music.
                        As a result of my years of experience teaching violin, I have developed a truly unique teaching method unmatched by any other.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Every student has different abilities and needs. I tailor my lesson plans to each student’s interests and goals.
                        To find out more about me and my class scheduling, you are welcome to browse the pages of my website.
